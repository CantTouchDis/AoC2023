The input.txt files for each day have been excluded from the git repository [to be as rule complient as possible](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about#faq_copying). You can still run `cargo test` to see the test inputs being processed for each day.
If you copy your input into the specific days assets folder you can also use `cargo run` and `cargo bench --features unstable`. You can run specific days (e.g. day-01) by running `cargo test -p day-01` or by just navigating into the folder.
